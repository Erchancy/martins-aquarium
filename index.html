                    Food, water, filtration and heat are the basic elements you’ll need to provide for your pet fish, but the exact specifications will depend on the type of fish you choose, how big it grows and a number of other factors.
                    Depending on the type of fish you choose, you’ll need an aquarium large enough to support the fish’s growth, with an air pump and submersible heater.

                <p>
                    A good rule of thumb for aquarium size is one gallon of water per every inch of full-grown fish.
                    Tropical fish require heating elements in their habitats, but there are some freshwater fish (like goldfish) that prefer cooler temperatures and may not need a heater.
                    It’s crucial that you do your research to find out what specific equipment the pet fish you’re considering needs.
